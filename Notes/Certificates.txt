What is DER?
DER is a method of encoding files.

What is PEM? (Privacy Enhanced Mail)
PEM is a method of encoding binary data as a string, called the ASCII armor. It contains a header and a footer, and the data in the middle is the base64 data. In the case that it is encoding a certificate, it would simply contain the base64 encoding of a DER encoded certificate.

What is CER/CRT?
A CER/CRT just stands for a certificate. It normally contains DER encoded data, but may also contain PEM encoded data. You need to look into the file contents to be sure. CER is used in Unix based systems. CRT is used in Windows.

What is .key?
A key could be a private or a public key. It usually is a private key. This could be encoded as a binary DER or an ASCII PEM.

What is x509?
X509 is a certificate that contains a public key. This public key is signed by the key in the certificate. (Need to verify this.)

What is a certificate?
You want a signed certificate. You get your certificate signed from an authority called CA (certificate authority), or you just create a self-signed certificate. To request the signing of a certificate, you fill out a CSR (Certificate Signing Request) and also provide the public key. These items are then embedded in the certificate when the certificate is actually signed.

Notes:
ASN.1 is the data representation language that describes the certificate structure.

Here's the chain of activity: You have a public key -> You might sign it with the key contained in an x509 certificate (whose structure is defined by ASN.1 standard) -> The certificate now contains the signed public key -> This certificate is now DER encoded -> It might then be PEM encoded.

Abbreviations:
ASN - Abstract Syntax Notation.
PEM - Privacy Enhanced Mail.
CSR - Certificate Signing Request.

Important: The only time CRT and CER can be interchanged is when encoding type is identical. (i,e., PEM encoded CRT = PEM encoded CER.)
